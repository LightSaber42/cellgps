# Adding Privacy Policy to achievetherapy.co.uk

## Quick Steps

1. **Copy the HTML file to your website repository:**
   - Copy `privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html` to your achievetherapy.co.uk GitHub repository
   - Place it in the root directory (same level as `index.html` or `privacy-policy.html`)

2. **Rename the file (optional):**
   - You can rename it to something shorter like `cell-signal-logger-privacy.html`
   - Or keep it as `privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html`

3. **Your privacy policy URL will be:**
   ```
   https://achievetherapy.co.uk/privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html
   ```
   Or if you rename it:
   ```
   https://achievetherapy.co.uk/cell-signal-logger-privacy.html
   ```

4. **Add to Play Console:**
   - Go to Play Console → Your App → Policy → App content
   - Enter: `https://achievetherapy.co.uk/privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html`
   - Save

## Alternative: Add Link from Main Privacy Policy

If you want to link to it from your existing privacy policy page, you can add:

```html
<p><a href="/privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html">Privacy Policy for Cell Signal Logger App</a></p>
```

## File Structure

Your repository structure should look like:
```
your-repo/
├── index.html
├── privacy-policy.html (existing)
├── privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html (new)
└── ... other files
```

## GitHub Pages Setup

If using GitHub Pages:
1. Push the HTML file to your repository
2. GitHub Pages will automatically serve it
3. The URL will be available immediately (or within a few minutes)

## Testing

After adding the file:
1. Visit: `https://achievetherapy.co.uk/privacy-policy-cell-signal-logger.html`
2. Verify it loads correctly
3. Check that all formatting looks good
4. Test the "Back to Home" link works

## Notes

- The HTML file is self-contained with inline CSS
- It matches the style of your existing privacy policy
- Uses the same contact email (info@achievetherapy.com)
- Includes "Back to Home" link for navigation
